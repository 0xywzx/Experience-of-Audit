# Experience of Audit

## About

This site serves as a platform for sharing audit experiences among crypto businesses.

## **Purpose of This Site**

There exists a notable **gap in the sharing of audit-related information** among crypto businesses.

Despite **auditing being a significant expense for crypto enterprise**s, many businesses commission audits **without clear reasons or criteria**.

Furthermore, the quality of an audit can vary significantly based on the **preparations** made by the auditee. However, there's a lack of shared knowledge on how to adequately prepare to ensure a smooth and high-quality audit process.

The primary objective of this site is to address this **information asymmetry** and to demystify the "black box" nature of audits. By sharing insights from those who have undergone audits, we aim to provide v**aluable criteria** for businesses about to embark on the audit process, thereby contributing to the overall integrity of the industry.
